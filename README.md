# Memory Game


This project is intended to put into practice, the following Python and programming 
essentials: 



* Variables and Data Types 
* User Input 
* Basic Operators 
* Conditional Statements 
* Loops 
* Functions 

## Essential Concepts

### Variables and Data Types 
**Variable:** A named object that stores data in memory.

**Data Type:** Defines the type of data stored in memory, usually in a variable.

In Python the basic Data Types are:

* **Int** - Integer number (e.g, 10, -3, 42)
* **float** - Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0)
* **str** - Strings (text) (e.g., "Hello", 'Python')
* **bool** - Boolean values (True or False)
* **list** - Ordered collections (e.g., [1, 2, 3])

### User Input 
User Input allows the program to receive data from the user, typically trough the keyboard, using: 

```python
name = input ('Enter your name: ')
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

### Basic Operators 
Python provides different types of operators, including:


* **Arithmetic Operators** (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
* **Logical Operators** (and, or, not)
* **Bitwise Operators** (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)

### Conditional Statements 
Conditional statements allow the program to make decision using boolean logic:

```Python
age = 18 
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else: 
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### Loops 
Loops allow repeated execution of a block of code while a condition holds true: 

```Python
for i in rage(5):
    print("Iteration:", i)
```

### Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task:

```Python 
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name 

print(greet("Alice"))
```
